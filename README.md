# Oil Shocks and Schooling Choices

## About

This research, conducted with the support of GGGI and UNEP under the SPAR6C program, contributes to public policy discussions in the areas of energy transition and carbon markets. The research aims to address the following questions:

- How do young people's preferences for entering green careers change in response to oil production shocks?
- How can the carbon market under Article 6 contribute to facilitating a just energy transition and the creation of green jobs in Colombia?

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to provide a platform for sharing research materials, data, and code related to the impact of oil shocks on schooling choices and the role of carbon markets in energy transition and green job creation in Colombia.

### About the Corresponding Author:

I am Brigitte Castañeda Rodríguez, a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at Universidad de los Andes (Bogotá, Colombia), under the guidance of Professor Hernando Zuleta. Currently, I am part of the inaugural cohort of graduate students in the Carbon Market Mentoring Program, established as part of the Supporting Readiness for Article 6 Cooperation (SPAR6C) program, co-led by the Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI) and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP).

My research interests lie at the intersection of macroeconomics and environmental economics, focusing on providing actionable insights for Carbon Markets and Just Transition policies.

In my thesis, the first article investigates the impact of carbon taxes on economic growth and employment, emphasizing the significance of the energy mix. The second chapter delves into structural change and energy efficiency in Latin American countries, alongside the effects of carbon pricing policies on these variables. Lastly, the final chapter explores the fiscal resource curse, revealing its nationwide implications beyond the producing municipalities in Colombia.

Previously, I have served as a consultant for the Colombian Ministry of Finance (CFS), the Colombian National Planning Department (CREE), and the World Bank.

I will be on the Job Market in 2024/2025.
